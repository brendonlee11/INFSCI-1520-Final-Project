# Electrical Vehicle Population Data Analysis for the State of Washington

Data Analysis conducted for INFSCI 1520: Data Visualization offered through the University of Pittsburgh School of Computing and Information. This project focused on creating effective and efficient visualizations of electric vehicles within the state of Washington. The information presented above can help assist future owners of EVs,
car dealers, and anyone who is interested in owning an EV in making smart decisions
on where to purchase their cars, where to reside, etc. Future owners will know which
parts of Washington are EV driver-friendly, and car dealers will know where to sell their
EVs, whether they want less competition or a bigger market.
